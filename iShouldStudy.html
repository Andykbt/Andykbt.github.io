            <h1>Project Description</h1>
            <div class="container bg">
                <p>iShouldStudy is a project I built alongside <a href="https://www.behance.net/wendytrinh" class="link">Wendy Trinh</a> as a personal project over our break
                <br> and was heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.imissmycafe.com" class="link">imissmycafe</a> and <a href="https://www.imissmybar.com" class="link">imissmybar</a> with our own spin on it.
                <br /> I decided a web application would suit this project the best and I decided to use React
                <br /> as It was something that I was interested in and wanted to try at least once.
                <br /><br /> iShouldStudy is a web app that helps you study and reach your study goals:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pomodoro timer to help maintain a healthy study balance</li>
                        <li>a variety of ambient sounds to help users focus (cat purring is proven to reduce stress)</li>
                        <li>and some Lofi music for those who want to listen to some tunes</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>We built this project as we understand how difficult concentrating on something can be sometimes.
                    <br>Throughout my studies, I've often found myself struggling with keeping focus and concentrating.
                    <br>This would sometimes lead to me procrastinating for hours and only spending a tiny fraction of my
                    <br> time doing anything productive. Then I realised, that there are some cases where I've worked on
                    <br> something and I would go into a mode where I'm super concentrated, productive, and focused.
                    <br> After some digging, I realised that this was a real psychological state and it is called the <i style="font-weight: bold;"> Flow State</i>.

            <h1>What I Learnt</h1>
            <div class="container bg">
                <p>As this was one of my first "real" projects using React, I found myself getting stuck a lot of the times
                    <br> and would sometimes slow down the progress of my partner. Since i was initially having a tough time
                    <br> with React, I decided to take the initiative and study some online resources to help me understand it.
                    <br> <br> Here are some of the things I learnt:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Component-based programming</li>
                        <li>React</li>
                        <li>Hooks</li>
                        <li>useState()</li>
                        <li>useEffect()</li>
                    </ul>
